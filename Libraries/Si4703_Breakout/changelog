Library for Sparkfun Si4703 breakout board.
Simon Monk. 2011-09-09

This is a library wrapper and a few extras to the excellent code produced
by Nathan Seidle from Sparkfun (Beerware).

Nathan's comments......

Look for serial output at 57600bps.

The Si4703 ACKs the first byte, and NACKs the 2nd byte of a read.

1/18 - after much hacking, I suggest NEVER write to a register without first reading the contents of a chip.
ie, don't updateRegisters without first readRegisters.

If anyone manages to get this datasheet downloaded
http://wenku.baidu.com/view/d6f0e6ee5ef7ba0d4a733b61.html
Please let us know. It seem to be the latest version of the programming guide. It had a change on page 12 (write 0x8100 to 0x07)
that allowed me to get the chip working..

Also, if you happen to find "AN243: Using RDS/RBDS with the Si4701/03", please share. I love it when companies refer to
documents that don't exist.

1/20 - Picking up FM stations from a plane flying over Portugal! Sweet! 93.9MHz sounds a little soft for my tastes,s but
it's in Porteguese.

ToDo:
Display current status (from 0x0A) - done 1/20/11
Add RDS decoding - works, sort of
Volume Up/Down - done 1/20/11
Mute toggle - done 1/20/11
Tune Up/Down - done 1/20/11
Read current channel (0xB0) - done 1/20/11
Setup for Europe - done 1/20/11
Seek up/down - done 1/25/11

The Si4703 breakout does work with line out into a stereo or other amplifier. Be sure to test with different length 3.5mm
cables. Too short of a cable may degrade reception.

2/11/13 - Fixed for Arduino 1.0. Changed wire.send and wire.receive to wire.write and wire.read. Also added arduino.h and removed wprogram.h
